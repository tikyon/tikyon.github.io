I'm somewhat back! I didn't touch this for a year. It was a bit of a pain to get Jekyll back and running after the El Capitan update :\

(I went with the Homebrew route and successfully reinstalled Jekyll.)

I'm still figuring what to use this for. I have recently been playing around with Twitter Bootstrap, so I might revamp the look of this using that.
