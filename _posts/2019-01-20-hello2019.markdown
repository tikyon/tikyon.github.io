2019 has arrived. And I greeted it with wisdom teeth removal on one side XD;;

Late last year, I got back to playing [Pokemon GO](https://www.pokemongo.com/). I played during the 2016 launch but eventually stop; I couldn't remember the reason. If anyone wants to add me as friend, feel free to [tweet me](https://twitter.com/tikyon) your code! Downtown Toronto has so many stops, which is the reason I usually headed down there during _Community Day_ events. Missed out of the Feebas event due to the extreme cold and snowing weather, but maybe it was not such a bad thing based on the reddit posts. Oh well, no shiny Feebas.

I don't do new year resolution because I know I won't follow them. But I do hope to learn new things this year :)
